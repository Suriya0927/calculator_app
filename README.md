### Hi there..ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Suriyakanth** and this is my **simple calculator app** with modern GUI. You can make simple calculations with this app and you can contribute with this project if you are interested. 

> *The app is in development. So there is a chance to get some error in some scenario.*

## Libraries
  In this project, i have used python language for both UI and backend functionality. 
  And some libraries, frameworks also used. Here it is,
  
  -  PyQt6 [For front-end framework to create UI]
  -  Pyinstaller [To convert .py file to .exe executable file]


You can find the executable(.exe) file in `dist` folder, program and UI file in `code_and_UI_file` folder.
- to open the UI file `sampleCalc.ui`, type `pyqt6-tools designer` on your command prompt and hit enter.
  > [PyQt6 should be installed on your computer]

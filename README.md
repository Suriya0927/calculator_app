### Hi there..ðŸ‘‹
this is my <b>simple calculator</b> program
  
  This is a simple calculator app with modern GUI. You can make simple calculations with this app. You can contribute with this project if you are interested. 
> [!NOTE]
> The app is in development. So there is a chance to get some error in some scenario. 

  In this project, i use python for both UI and backend functionality. 
  and some libraries, frameworks also used. That is,
  
  -  PyQt6 [For front-end framework to create UI]
  -  Pyinstaller [To convert .py file to .exe executable file]


 Here, you can find the executable(.exe) file in `dist` folder, program and UI file in `code_and_UI_file` folder.
